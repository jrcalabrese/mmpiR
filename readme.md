I'm taking a course on assessment and decided to make a tool to create visualizations for my reports.

In the future, I want to add 1) a table-maker so you can export clean looking tables easily and 2) a conversion tool to auto-calculate T scores, but I might get sued by Pearson if I added that last one.

I hope to clean this up over time, add to it, and submit it to next year's Shiny contest. Suggestions welcome.
