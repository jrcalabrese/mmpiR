I took a course on psychological assessment in Fall 2021 and decided to make a tool to create visualizations for my reports.

In the future, I want to add a table-maker so you can export clean looking tables easily and a conversion tool to auto-calculate T scores, but I might get sued by Pearson if I added that the latter.

I hope to submit this to the 2022 Shiny Contest. Suggestions welcome.
